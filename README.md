# Anne of Green Gables: Editions
Proof-read and compare editions of _Anne of Green Gables_, by L. M. Montgomery.

This repo contains transcriptions of the book.
Each edition has a separate branch.

The <a href='https://johanley.github.io/anne-of-green-gables/index.html'>documentation</a> for the project is in a 
separate <a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables'>repo</a>, which doesn't share the same branching needs as this one.

This <em>master</em> branch contains only empty stub files for the chapters of the novel.

Each edition will have its own specific branch.
New branches can be made starting with empty stub files.
