# Anne of Green Gables: Editions
Proof-read and compare editions of _Anne of Green Gables_, by L. M. Montgomery.

This _1908-LCP-4th_ branch is for the 4th impression of the original 1908 L. C. Page edition. 
It was printed in September, 1908. (I would prefer to have the first impression, but that doesn't 
seem to be available on the web anywhere.)

This transcription was proof-read by John O'Hanley over a 24 day period.
It was then _diffed_ with three other transcriptions (which are other branches in this repo), in this order : 
* DIG-GUT-0000
* DIG-DPC-2008-05
* DIG-WIK-1908-11th

These _diff_ operations found 147 issues missed by the proof-reader.
