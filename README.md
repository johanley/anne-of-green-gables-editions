# Anne of Green Gables: Editions
Proof-read and compare editions of _Anne of Green Gables_, by L. M. Montgomery.

The 1908-LCP-4th branch is for the 4th impression of the original 1908 L. C. Page edition. It was printed in September, 1908. 

I would prefer to have the first impression, but that doesn't seem to be available on the web anywhere. There are likely a few corrections made between the 1st impression and the 4th impression.

The <a href='https://archive.org/details/cu31924013243963/page/n9/mode/2up'>copy-text</a> is from archive.org.


This repo contains transcriptions of the book.
Each edition has a separate branch.

The <a href='https://johanley.github.io/anne-of-green-gables/index.html'>documentation</a> for the project is in a 
separate <a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables'>repo</a>, which doesn't share the same branching needs as this one.
