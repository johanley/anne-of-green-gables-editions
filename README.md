# Anne of Green Gables: Editions
Proof-read and compare editions of _Anne of Green Gables_, by L. M. Montgomery.

This <em>DIG-DPC-2008-05</em> branch contains a digitized text from Digital Proofreaders Canada. The file was created in May of 2008. The raw file has also been uploaded to this branch, as a record of the exact source. It was downloaded from <a href='https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20080509'>here</a> on 2020-11-26. It states that it's based on a book published by Ryerson in 1946.

This repo contains transcriptions of the book.
Each edition has a separate branch.

The <a href='https://johanley.github.io/anne-of-green-gables/index.html'>documentation</a> for the project is in a 
separate <a href='https://github.com/johanley/anne-of-green-gables'>repo</a>, which doesn't share the same branching needs as this one.
