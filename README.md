# Anne of Green Gables: Editions
Proof-read and compare editions of _Anne of Green Gables_, by L. M. Montgomery.

This _1908-LCP-4th_ branch is for the 4th impression of the original 1908 L. C. Page edition. 
It was printed in September, 1908. 

(The 1st impression is available <a href='https://kindredspaces.ca/islandora/object/lmmi%3A1373?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=bea8968543c1027b364e&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=2#page/10/mode/1up'>here</a>, but I was unaware of that when I began this project.)

This transcription was proof-read by John O'Hanley over a 24 day period.
It was then _diffed_ with three other transcriptions (which are other branches in this repo), in this order: 
* DIG-GUT-0000
* DIG-DPC-2008-05
* DIG-WIK-1908-11th

The _diff_ operations found many issues with the various transcriptions:
* 147 issues in this transcription (missed during my proof-reading)
* 30 issues in the DIG-DPC-2008-05 transcription (Distributed Proofreaders of Canada/FadedPage)
* 109 issues in the DIG-WIK-1908-11th transcription (wikisource)

The transcription in this branch has a Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal. 
That's <a href='https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0'>roughly equivalent to public domain.</a>
