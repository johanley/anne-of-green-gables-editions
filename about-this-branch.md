# Anne of Green Gables: Editions

The 1908-LCP-4th branch is for the 4th impression of the original 1908 L. C. Page edition. It was printed in September, 1908. 

I would prefer to have the first impression, but that doesn't seem to be available on the web anywhere. There are likely a few corrections made between the 1st impression and the 4th impression.
